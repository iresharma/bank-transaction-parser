# Indian bank transaction sms parser

A swift version of an parser created by [saurabhgupta050890](https://github.com/saurabhgupta050890), here is the original [repo](https://github.com/saurabhgupta050890/transaction-sms-parser)

> I am very new to swift hence this repo only has basic syntactic conversion in form on arbitary swift code. I will be working on this to make it a proper package if enough interest is shown.
